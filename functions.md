- **Automated Import**
  - _Statistical Data Import:_ Enable uploading of airport statistical data files for use as a comparison baseline.
    - Implement a file upload interface accepting .zip or .csv files with the expected naming pattern (e.g. ending in \_XXX where XXX is the airport code).
    - Validate the uploaded file's format and naming convention, and parse its contents (e.g. traffic statistics data for a past period).
    - Import the parsed statistical data into the system's database for the "comparison period", making it available for baseline comparisons in scenarios.
    - Provide feedback or error messages if the file is not in the correct format or if data import fails, otherwise confirm the import was successful.
- **Group Editor**
  - _Group Management:_ Allow creation and maintenance of custom data groups for filtering and analysis.
    - Implement an interface to **add new group definitions**, specifying conditions (e.g. airline, region, flight type) that determine group membership.
    - Allow users to **edit or delete existing groups**, updating the group's criteria or removing the group entirely from the system.
    - Enable a way to **organize groups**, such as using folders or categories, to manage large numbers of group definitions (as referenced in the Group Editor user guide).
    - Provide an option to **share groups across projects or with other users**, so that certain commonly used group filters (e.g. specific airline alliances or regions) can be reused in multiple scenarios.
- **Import (Flight Schedule Import)**
  - _Import Initialization & File Selection:_ Guide the user through starting a new flight schedule import and choosing the source file.
    - Provide a multi-step **Import Wizard** - in Step 1, allow input of a name for the import (e.g. "Summer Schedule 2025") and selection of the import type (schedule vs. statistical data).
    - In Step 2, implement a file picker to **browse and select the schedule data file** (in the supported format) for import. Perform basic validation (file present, correct format) before proceeding.
  - _Field Mapping:_ Let users map columns from the input file to the system's flight data fields.
    - Display the list of columns detected in the uploaded file (with sample data) and the list of target database fields; for Step 3 of the wizard, provide dropdowns to **assign each file column to the appropriate database attribute** (flight number, origin, destination, etc.).
    - Highlight mandatory fields in the UI (e.g. in red) and ensure the user maps all required columns before continuing. Allow optional fields to be mapped if present.
    - Store the mapping configuration (possibly allowing reuse for future imports of the same format) and validate that all required mappings are provided.
  - _Filter Settings & Business Rules:_ Configure which records to import and apply optional transformation rules.
    - In Step 4, present options to **filter the import by date or group** - the user selects the target scenario period (start/end date) for which flights should be imported. If a predefined group is chosen, import only flights that match that group's criteria.
    - Provide an option to **remove existing flights in the scenario's target period** before importing (to avoid duplicate flights if importing an updated schedule for the same timeframe).
    - If the system supports "business rules" (automated data conversion rules), allow the user to apply those during import. For example, enable toggling on a rule set that automatically replaces certain aircraft types or codes as defined in a template.
    - Include a setting to configure which data columns are considered when doing flight comparison in the next step (e.g. choose whether flight number, times, etc. are used to identify updates vs. new flights).
  - _Flight Schedule Comparison:_ Show a preview comparing the incoming data to the current scenario flights and allow selective import.
    - Implement Step 5 to **display an overview of flights** in the import file versus flights already in the scenario. Highlight counts of new flights, updated flights (matching by flight number/date but with differences), and flights in scenario not in the import (potential cancellations).
    - Provide an interactive comparison view where users can **decide which flights to include**. For a quick high-level choice, allow selecting or deselecting all flights of each category (e.g. exclude all "cancelled" flights).
    - Include a "Comparison Details" drill-down: a tabbed interface (or similar) listing **Cancelled**, **Updated**, and **New** flights. Allow the user to review individual records in each tab.
    - For each flight in the detailed list, allow actions such as **excluding a specific flight from import** (e.g. by unchecking it) if the user does not want it to be imported or to override an update. Enable saving these selections.
  - _Basic Data Integration:_ Automatically handle any new reference data (airlines, airports, etc.) found in the import.
    - In Step 6 of the wizard, implement a check comparing attributes of flights in the import against the system's master data (e.g. does each airline code, airport code, aircraft type exist in the database?).
    - For any **unrecognized codes or entities**, create placeholder entries (dummy records) in the relevant reference tables. For example, if a new airline or a new aircraft type appears, add it to the system with minimal info so that the flights can be imported.
    - Log or list how many new reference records will be created in each category (so the user is aware). Allow the user to later edit these placeholder records in the master data management.
    - Once ready, provide a "Start Import" action that commits the flights data into the scenario.
  - _Import Summary & Completion:_ Finalize the import process and summarize results.
    - After processing, present a **summary (Step 7)** indicating how many flight records were successfully imported into the scenario. Break down the count of new flights added, existing flights updated, and any that were skipped due to duplicates or user choice.
    - Show how many new reference data entries (airlines, airports, etc.) were created automatically.
    - Implement logic to skip importing a flight if it would duplicate an existing flight number in the same period (to avoid exact duplicates); count these as skipped duplicates in the summary.
    - Provide a completion action (e.g. a button "Go to Calendar View") that, when clicked, takes the user to the updated scenario timeline so they can view the imported schedule in context.
- **Flight Event Generator (FEG)**
  - _Generation Settings:_ Allow the user to define the target number of flights to generate and the scope for generation.
    - Provide a UI (Step 1 of FEG) where the user inputs the **target number of movements (flights)** to add to the scenario (e.g. "Generate 500 additional flights"). This establishes the gap between the current schedule and the desired future schedule.
    - Let the user select the **grouping criteria for generation** - for example, choose a carrier group and region group that will be used to distribute the new flights. (Prerequisite: ensure the scenario has some base schedule or imported movements and that relevant carrier/region groups exist from the Group Editor).
    - Offer default settings or templates for this step if available, and validate that the user's inputs make sense (e.g. target number is positive, required groups are selected).
  - _Group Distribution:_ Distribute the target new flights across airlines, regions, and aircraft types according to user-defined shares.
    - Implement an interface for Step 2 that lists the **selected carrier groups**, and for each, allow the user to specify what percentage or number of the target flights to allocate. For example, distribute 60% of new flights to a legacy carriers group and 40% to low-cost carriers.
    - Once carrier share is set, provide a sub-step to allocate each carrier group's share across **region groups**. For each carrier group, list region categories and allow the user to define how many flights for that carrier category go to each region. This enables a two-dimensional distribution (Carrier X in Region Y gets Z flights).
    - Next, allow the user to specify the **aircraft type distribution** for each carrier-region combination. Show a list of aircraft types (with reference to current scenario or typical usage) and let the user set the percentage of flights that should use each aircraft type. Include productivity tools like "Copy Shares" (to copy current scenario's distribution as a starting point) or "Set Top-X Shares" (auto-distribute 100% across the top N aircraft types) to speed up input.
    - Ensure the distributions entered are valid (percents sum to 100% or counts sum appropriately). The system should use these inputs to calculate exactly how many flights to generate for each \[carrier-region-aircraft\] combination.
  - _Generation Constraints (Dashboard Settings):_ Provide options to fine-tune how and when flights are generated, including curfews and peak hour preferences.
    - In Step 3, present a **"Dashboard" of FEG settings** where the user can adjust advanced generation parameters. Include a **Curfew setting**: allow definition of time ranges during which no new flights should be generated (e.g. night curfew hours). This might involve selecting a pre-made "Curfew Template" from System Settings or creating one (with start/end times for no-flight periods).
    - Include **peak hours and day-of-week preferences**: let the user choose a "FEG Settings" template that contains preferred patterns for flight generation. For example, a template might indicate which hours of day are considered peak (preferred for placing new flights) and which day-of-week combinations to use for flight frequencies. If the user has created such templates (carrying parameters for specific carrier and region groups), allow them to select them here.
    - If no custom templates are selected, apply default best-practice settings for how to distribute flights over the week and day (the system's built-in defaults). Clearly inform the user that defaults will apply if no template is used.
    - Validate the combination of chosen templates and groups - for instance, ensure the carrier/region groups used in the templates match those used in Step 1 so that the preferences align with the generation scope.
  - _Flight Generation & Summary:_ Execute the generation algorithm to create new flight events and present the outcome.
    - When the user proceeds to Step 4 (Summary), use the inputs from prior steps to **generate the missing flights**. The algorithm should iterate for each carrier/region/aircraft combination: create flight records until the target count for that combo is reached, adhering to the patterns defined.
    - Implement logic to determine **weekly flight frequency patterns**: use historical data (e.g. previous season schedules) to identify common day-of-week combinations for each carrier/region pair. Assign new flights to specific days of the week based on the most frequent patterns (for example, daily service vs. weekdays-only service) until the required number of flights is allocated. If a combination requires more flights than a single pattern provides, use the next most common pattern for the remainder.
    - Determine **flight times** for each new flight, aligning with peak hour preferences and avoiding curfew periods. For each flight, pick an arrival or departure time based on the scenario's existing peak hour distribution (e.g. concentrate new flights in busy hour windows unless otherwise directed). Ensure no flight is placed during a curfew; if needed, adjust times to the nearest allowed slot.
    - Apply **turnaround pairing** if applicable: for every generated arrival, generate a corresponding departure (or vice versa) if the scenario requires round trips, ensuring they respect a minimum turnaround time. Use the airport's configured turnaround times per aircraft type to schedule the return leg appropriately.
    - After generation, display a **summary of results**: how many flights were generated in total and a breakdown by carrier group and region as defined. Provide details such as "X flights for Carrier A in Region Y (using Z aircraft type) were added."
    - Allow the user to review the newly generated flights (perhaps list a few examples or give an option to inspect them in the main Movements view). The Summary step finalizes the FEG process and updates the scenario with the new flights.
- **Analysis of Views (Movement Analysis)**
  - _Calendar & Data Grid View:_ Provide an interactive view of scenario movements over time with the ability to drill down by period.
    - Implement a **Flight Calendar View** where the user can select a time period (year, month, week, or specific day). When a period is selected, display a **graphical breakdown (Breakdown 1 & 2)** of movements vs. capacity for that period. For example, show a bar chart of movements and seats by month or by day.
    - Alongside the graphical breakdown, display a **Data Grid** (tabular view) listing detailed traffic values for the selected period. The data grid should include metrics like number of flights (movements), seats, passengers, etc., broken down by relevant categories.
    - Implement sorting and column visibility toggling in the data grid: allow the user to sort the table by any column (e.g. by number of movements) and to hide/show columns via checkboxes (without deleting data).
    - Include an **export to Excel** function from the data grid so that the user can extract the tabular data for external analysis. The Calendar/Data Grid view as a whole helps the user get both a high-level graphical summary and a detailed data table for the chosen time slice.
  - _Volume View (Scenario vs. Comparison):_ Visualize weekly flight frequencies and compare scenario data to a baseline.
    - Create a **Volume View** that aggregates the number of movements (flights) on a weekly basis, split by season (e.g. winter vs. summer) and by airline and destination. In this view, show side-by-side comparisons of the scenario's planned flights and the comparison period's flights (baseline) to highlight growth or decline.
    - Enable interactive comparison: for example, allow the user to filter the Volume View to **compare scenario vs. last year's schedule**. The view should clearly indicate for each airline how many weekly flights are in the scenario vs. in the comparison data, often separated by season (marked as "Wi" for winter, "Su" for summer in the interface).
    - Make the volume chart interactive: if the user clicks on a specific airline, update the breakdown to show destinations for that airline (drilling down into that airline's contribution). Likewise, allow sorting the list of airlines by their frequencies.
    - Display data for both scenario and comparison so that differences are visible. For instance, if Airline X had 50 weekly flights last summer and now has 60 in the scenario, show both values. This helps identify where the schedule has increased or decreased.
  - _Frequency Adjustment Tool:_ Allow quick adjustments of flight frequencies by airline and regenerate flights accordingly.
    - Within the Volume View, implement an **editable field for target frequency** for each airline (or each airline-destination pair) that the user can change. For example, if an airline currently has 5 weekly flights in the scenario, the user can double-click that number and input a new target (e.g. 6). Mark edited targets visibly (e.g. highlight in red) to indicate a pending change.
    - Provide a "Generate" or "Apply" action that, when triggered, **adds or removes flights to meet the new target frequency**. If the target was raised, create the necessary additional flights (similar to a mini-FEG operation but specific to that airline/destination). If the target was lowered, remove excess flights (likely the latest added or by some defined logic).
    - Once applied, update the Volume View: the adjusted frequency number should turn green (indicating the change has been realized) and both the scenario and comparison tables should reflect the new counts.
    - Ensure that when adding flights via this tool, all relevant details are handled (e.g. assign times, ensure no constraint violations). Similarly, when deleting, handle linked flights or other dependencies properly (e.g. remove return flight if its outbound is canceled).
    - This tool allows users to interactively fine-tune the schedule by carrier without running the full FEG process, and immediately see the results in the weekly summary view.
- **Runway Constraints View (PRO)**
  - _Runway Constraint Templates:_ Provide a mechanism to define runway capacity rules (constraints) that can be applied to the schedule.
    - Implement a **Runway Constraint (RC) Manager** accessible from the Runway Constraints View. In the RC Manager, allow users to **create, edit, and save constraint templates**. Each template will represent a set of rules like "X movements per Y minutes" for specific time periods of the day.
    - Support different types of constraints: for example, a **Rolling constraint** (moving window) or a **Weighted constraint** (different limits in sub-intervals). Allow users to specify intervals (e.g. 15-minute blocks) and assign max arrival/departure counts for those intervals. For instance, a template might stipulate "4 arrivals per 15 minutes from 06:30-06:59, then 5 arrivals per 15 minutes from 07:00-07:29".
    - If needed, handle advanced options like taking an average of two constraint values when transitioning (as hinted by "use the average of two divergent runway constraints"). Ensure the template format can capture such details.
    - Include basic toolbar functions in the RC Manager (New Template, Save, Delete, Import/Export templates) to manage these constraint sets. Once a template is saved, it should be available for selection in the Runway Constraints View.
  - _Visualization of Constraints vs Schedule:_ Display the flight schedule against the defined runway constraints to identify any violations.
    - Create the **Runway Constraints View** screen which is divided into a calendar selector and an internal detailed view. In the **RC Calendar View quadrant**, show a calendar (by month, week, day) where a user can pick a timeframe. When a date range (e.g. a specific day, week number, or entire month) is selected, populate the **Internal View** with the constraint analysis for that period.
    - In the Internal View, list time slots (e.g. every 5 minutes or the smallest interval defined by constraints) as rows, and show for each slot the number of flights scheduled ("is" number) vs. the allowed number ("ought" number from the active constraint template). For example, for each 15-minute interval in a day, display how many arrivals actually occur and how many are permitted.
    - Use **color-coding** to make the analysis intuitive: perhaps green where actual flights are under the limit, and red where they exceed (violations). Provide a legend explaining the colors (accessible via a "Show Legend" toggle).
    - Enable a **tooltip or popup** when hovering on a cell that shows details of that interval (e.g. exact start/end time of the interval). This helps clarify the duration of custom interval lengths (especially in rolling constraints).
    - Allow the user to **drill down**: clicking on a specific interval cell in the Internal View should bring up or highlight the list of individual flights in that interval on the main screen. Mark flights that violate constraints (e.g. those beyond the allowed count) with a red indicator.
    - On the main flight list (for the selected period), support sorting and filtering so the user can easily find flights, especially those flagged as violations. Also enable editing of flights directly in this view (e.g. adjust a flight's time) as a means to manually resolve a violation.
  - _Enforcement of Runway Constraints (Flight Spilling):_ Provide an automated way to adjust the schedule to meet the runway constraints, by shifting or removing flights.
    - Implement a function (often called **"Flight Spilling"** or constraint enforcement) that can automatically modify the scenario so that it complies with the selected runway constraint template. This could be initiated by a "Resolve Violations" or similar action in the Runway Constraints View.
    - When triggered, the system should attempt to **shift flights** that violate constraints to the nearest available time slots where capacity is available, following rules from the RC Manager. For example, if too many arrivals are at 07:00, it might try moving one to a slightly later time if allowed. Ensure that when shifting, operational considerations are respected: maintain aircraft rotation integrity (don't break turnaround links - departures should stay paired with their arrivals within a day when possible) and obey any maximum delay settings.
    - If shifting cannot resolve all conflicts (i.e. there are still too many flights in a constrained interval), implement logic to **cancel (delete) flights as a last resort**. Follow the prescribed priority for removals: first remove flights that were system-generated by the FEG, next remove any manually added flights, and only then remove originally imported scheduled flights (since those are usually more "fixed"). This tiered deletion ensures minimal impact on core schedule content.
    - After the adjustment, provide a summary of actions: which flights were moved (and to what new times) and which flights, if any, were removed. Mark any removed flights distinctly (possibly list them as canceled due to constraints).
    - Update the Runway Constraints View display post-adjustment so the user can verify that no interval now exceeds the allowed limit (all "is" numbers should be <= "ought" numbers). The user should also see the adjusted schedule in the main Movements view, with any deleted flights no longer present.
- **Linked Flights (Rotation Pairing)**
  - _Linking Configuration:_ Provide options to set how flights are paired as turnarounds (arrivals to subsequent departures).
    - In the **Linked Flights** module, present initial settings for how linking should be performed. Include a toggle to **"Override Manual Links" vs. "Keep Manual Links"** - if override is chosen, any existing user-defined pairings will be cleared and recalculated; if keep is chosen, the algorithm will only link flights that are currently unlinked, preserving any manual pairings.
    - Offer a choice of **linking algorithm strategy**: for example, **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** where the earliest arriving flight is linked to the earliest departing flight that can follow it, versus **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** which might pair the latest arrival with the earliest departure, etc. These strategies determine how the matching is done when multiple candidates exist.
    - Provide additional yes/no options to relax constraints: one setting might **allow cross-destination linking** (link flights even if they have different destination categories, if the user wants maximum pairing flexibility), and another might **allow linking flights with mismatched seat counts** (useful if an exact aircraft rotation isn't required). Enabling these ("Yes") increases flexibility in finding links; disabling means links will only be made if certain attributes match (like same aircraft capacity).
    - Let the user select which **carrier group(s) or specific carriers** the linking should apply to. For instance, they may choose to only link flights within the same airline, or even allow linking between allied carriers if operationally plausible. This selection can override default carrier separation rules (e.g. normally flights of different airlines wouldn't link, but if an alliance group is specified, treat them as eligible to link).
  - _Execute Linking Algorithm:_ Once configured, run the logic that pairs arrivals with departures as aircraft turnarounds and update the scenario data.
    - On clicking "Link Flights," traverse the flight schedule and **identify candidate pairs**. The system should search for an arrival flight and a departure flight that occur within a feasible time window (the gap between arrival time and departure time defines the turnaround). Use the **Aircraft by Airline settings** from system configurations to know the minimum and maximum allowable turnaround times for each airline or aircraft type. For example, ensure at least X minutes and no more than Y minutes separate an arrival and the next departure for them to be linkable as one aircraft's rotation.
    - If multiple link possibilities exist, apply the chosen FIFO/LIFO strategy. For FIFO: link the earliest arrival to the earliest departure that meets the criteria (same day or within allowed 36-hour window, etc.). For LIFO: perhaps link the latest arrival of the day to the earliest departure that follows it, and so on.
    - When linking, consider flights with **similar flight numbers** as likely turnarounds (the system by default searches for arrivals and departures with the same or similar flight numbers within +/- 1 day to pair up). Use flight number similarity as one heuristic but not the only factor (carrier and timing are more deterministic).
    - Respect the user's flexibility options: if linking across carriers was allowed for a specified group, permit that; if seat count difference was allowed, do not restrict linking flights that have different seat capacities. If these options were "No," then only link flights that share those attributes (ensuring a true same-plane turnaround).
    - Apply the min/max turnaround constraints: use the configured defaults (e.g. default min 25 minutes, max 36 hours if no specific entry exists for that airline/aircraft) to decide if an arrival at time T can link to a departure at time T+Δ. Only link if Δ is between the minimum and maximum.
    - As the algorithm links flights, mark those flights in the system as **linked pairs** (store an association between the arrival and departure). If any existing links were to be preserved (Keep Manual Links), ensure those are left untouched; if override, clear them initially and re-link from scratch.
    - Once complete, provide a **summary of linking results**: how many flights were linked into turnarounds. Possibly show how many pairs were created and list any flights that remain unlinked (like orphan arrivals or departures that could not find a pair). The outcome is that the scenario now has rotations established, which can be important for downstream capacity and stand planning.
- **Cancellation Rate**
  - _Cancellation Scenario Setup:_ Enable the user to simulate flight cancellations over a specific period, optionally filtered by group.
    - Provide inputs to **select a date range** (Start Date and End Date) for which the cancellation should apply. Only flights within this period will be considered for removal.
    - Allow selection of an optional **Group filter** (e.g. a particular airline or route group). If a group is chosen, only flights belonging to that group will be eligible for cancellation. (For example, "cancel 10% of flights for low-cost carriers in July").
    - Once the scope is set, implement a **Preview** function that scans the scenario and counts how many flights fall into the selected range (and group, if applied). Display this number so the user knows the total pool of flights that could be affected.
    - Provide input options for the user to specify the **amount of cancellation** either as a percentage of flights or an absolute number of flights to remove. For instance, the user might enter "10%" or "50 flights". Validate this against the preview count (10% of 200 flights = 20 flights, etc.).
  - _Execute Cancellations:_ Remove the specified flights from the scenario according to the configured rate, prioritizing independent flights first.
    - When the user clicks "Cancel Flights," identify the exact flights to be removed. The system should first target **unlinked flights** (flights that are not part of a linked arrival-departure pair) because canceling those will have less cascade effect. Randomly or evenly select unlinked flights up to the desired count/percentage for removal.
    - If the number to cancel exceeds the count of unlinked flights, then proceed to remove **linked flights** as needed. When removing linked flights, remove them in pairs if possible (to maintain consistent rotations - e.g. if an outbound and return are linked, canceling one should imply canceling its pair). The documentation indicates linked pairs are deleted after unlinked, so ensure that if you must cancel a linked flight, you also cancel its counterpart to avoid a dangling one-leg rotation.
    - Implement the actual deletion from the scenario: those flights should be marked as canceled or completely removed from the dataset. Ensure any downstream data (passenger allocations, etc.) are also handled (they would be dropped or need reallocation if flights are removed).
    - Provide a confirmation or summary once done: e.g. "30 flights were canceled (20 unlinked flights and 5 linked pairs)." This lets the user verify that the correct magnitude of reduction was achieved. The scenario flight list and analytics should now reflect fewer flights for that period/group, simulating a schedule cut.
- **Load Factor View**
  - _Data Selection & Time Settings:_ Allow the user to pick which forecast data to view or edit and define the time scope.
    - In the Load Data section, present a **Settings panel** where the user can choose a specific data "product" or category to work on - for example, Seat Load Factor (SLF, passengers per seat), total passenger numbers, transfer passengers, baggage, freight, etc. These represent different datasets attached to flights.
    - Let the user select the relevant **period** (e.g. a particular month, season, or the entire year) for which they want to view/adjust the load factors. There may be preset period options or the ability to specify custom date ranges.
    - Provide a way to adjust the **time granularity or segmentation** if needed. For instance, an "Edit Time Settings" (pen icon) could allow switching between viewing data by month vs. by day, or selecting which forecasting time slices (peak day vs. average day) to consider.
    - After the user has chosen the product and time frame, implement a **"Reload View"** action that applies these settings and loads the data into the main Load Factor view. This will populate the screen with the current values from the scenario for the chosen data type and period.
  - _Define Breakdown Structure:_ Let users break down the load data by various dimensions for detailed analysis and input.
    - Provide controls (perhaps a "Breakdowns" button or panel) that allow the user to **select one or several breakdown levels** for the data display. For example, they might break down passenger loads by airline, by destination region, and by cabin class if applicable. The UI could present available breakdown dimensions (carrier, route, flight type, etc.) and the user can move desired ones into a "Selected breakdowns" list.
    - Ensure the breakdowns can be ordered hierarchically (the order determines nesting in the data grid on the main screen). For instance, Breakdown 1 = Airline, Breakdown 2 = Destination would first separate data by airline, then within each airline by destination.
    - Once breakdowns are chosen, allow the user to **apply these settings** (e.g. an "Adjust Settings" confirmation) and refresh the view (similar to Reload). The main screen should now show the data broken out by the selected dimensions.
    - If the system supports multi-level breakdown beyond two, include an option (icon next to a row) to **add further breakdowns dynamically**. For example, a "+" icon could expand an entry to show the next level of detail (this might correspond to the mention of an icon next to the Home button for further breakdowns).
    - The goal is to give a pivot-table-like view of load factors. For example, the user could see the average seat load factor per airline per month, or total bags per flight by route, depending on breakdowns.
  - _Edit Load Factors per Breakdown:_ Allow adjustments to forecasted load factors or volumes at various breakdown levels, with multiple methods for input.
    - For the selected breakdown view, make the load factor or load value cells editable. The user should be able to click on a value (e.g. an average load factor %) and either **enter a new value directly**, **increase/decrease it by a certain amount**, or choose to **copy a value from the comparison period** (historical actual data). Provide controls for these options: for instance, buttons or menu for "Copy from last year" or "Add 5%".
    - When the user makes an edit (say sets load factor for Airline X in July to 85%), propagate that change appropriately: either to all flights under that breakdown or flagged to apply in the adjustment step. Possibly highlight changed values in the interface (so they stand out, e.g. colored cell background).
    - If the interface allows "add" vs "set" operations: implement logic such that "add 5" would increment the existing value by 5 (percentage points or absolute number), whereas "set" replaces it. Confirm changes via an "Adjust" or "Apply" action for that breakdown level.
    - Upon adjustment, **recalculate the affected detailed values**. For example, if the user sets an airline's monthly load factor, all flights for that airline in that month might be adjusted proportionally. Or if they set a total passengers number, redistribute it across flights under that category. The system should update the scenario's underlying data for each flight event to match the new aggregated targets.
    - Allow the user to iterate through different data types: after adjusting seat load factor, they might switch to another product (like transfer passengers or bags) and the interface should present a similar breakdown and editing capability. Ensure consistency so that all types of load data (PAX, bags, freight, etc.) can be adjusted in this manner one after another.
    - Once editing is done, the new load factors/volumes are now in the scenario. These changes will be reflected in reports or other views, showing the impact of the adjusted forecast distribution.
- **Forecast Adjustment**
  - _Adjustment Template & Scope:_ Allow users to set up an automatic forecast adjustment, potentially saving the configuration for reuse.
    - Implement a feature where the user can **create a Forecast Adjustment template** - this includes selecting parameters like the date range, data products, and whether to reset existing values. Provide options to **add a new template, choose an existing one, or delete a template**. The benefit is that a user can reuse the same adjustment settings for multiple scenarios or iterative runs.
    - Within the adjustment settings, include a toggle for **"Apply to all entries or not"**. If set to apply to all entries (reset = yes), the adjustment will wipe out current load factors and recalc fresh values for every flight. If not, perhaps it will only fill in missing data or adjust a subset, leaving manual overrides intact (this setting essentially decides if we start from scratch or layer on existing data).
    - Let the user specify the **target period (start and end dates)** over which the adjustment should be applied. This could be the entire scenario or just a particular season or month that they want to adjust.
    - Allow selection of the **data products** (metrics) the adjustment should generate - for example, seat load factor, total passengers, bags, etc. The user might check which datasets to adjust automatically. Only those checked will be recalculated; others might remain as is.
    - Provide a clear description that this feature will **delete existing load factor values and compute new ones** based on high-level breakdown criteria (so the user is aware of the impact).
  - _Breakdown Selection for Adjustment:_ Configure the macro-level distribution rules that the forecast adjustment will use to allocate values.
    - Present an interface for selecting the **breakdown structure** that the automated forecast algorithm will use. This could be similar to the breakdown selection in Load Factor View but specifically for guiding the adjustment logic. For example, the user might choose breakdown levels: Airline, then Destination, then Quarter.
    - Include a concept of a **"stop level"** in the breakdown hierarchy: the stop level is the lowest breakdown that the algorithm must consider for adjustment. The system will ensure it at least adjusts data down to that granularity. Any deeper breakdown levels beyond the stop level will be used only if data naturally exists for them. (E.g. if stop level is Airline, the adjustment guarantees each airline's total is matched, and if a deeper breakdown like route is present, it will distribute among routes only if route data exist).
    - Provide guidance in the UI that the adjustment will allocate forecast values across all flights, honoring the chosen breakdowns. Essentially, the system might take known totals or trends and distribute them.
    - Once breakdown settings are chosen, the user triggers the adjustment by clicking an **"Adjust Forecast"** button. Ensure a confirmation if this action will erase current values (especially if reset all was selected).
  - _Automated Factor Recalculation:_ Perform the adjustment, recalculating load factors or loads for all flights in the selected scope according to the breakdown template.
    - On running the adjustment, the system should **clear existing load factor data** for the target period (if instructed to do so) and then compute new values. Use historical or comparison data as needed - for instance, if a comparison period is linked (like last year's actuals), the algorithm might derive growth rates or patterns from it.
    - Allocate forecasted totals down the hierarchy: for example, if the airport expects 5% more passengers overall than last year, distribute this growth across airlines (perhaps uniformly or weighted by last year's share) since "Airline" is a breakdown level. Then within each airline, distribute across destination regions (next breakdown) proportionally, and so on until reaching individual flight level. The outcome is that each flight gets a new passenger count or load factor that is consistent with the top-down forecast targets.
    - Ensure that the **stop level constraint is respected**: e.g. if stop level is "Region", make sure each region's total passengers match the intended forecast (and the algorithm can aggregate or disaggregate accordingly). If deeper levels have no data (say a particular combination doesn't exist in scenario), the algorithm should still honor the higher-level totals by allocating to whatever flights exist.
    - Once complete, the system now has **new load factors for every flight** in the period. The feature effectively automated what one might do manually in the Load Factor View, but across all flights simultaneously.
    - Present a summary or confirmation: for example, "Forecast adjustment applied to 3,000 flights for Jan-Mar; all load factors recalculated based on Airline -> Destination breakdown." If templates were used, they can be saved for audit or reuse. The user can then review the adjusted values in the Load Data view (the prompt suggests results will show up there).
- **Forecast Organizer (Special Events Handling)**
  - _Special Events Definition:_ Allow definition of special events or anomalies so the forecast can treat them differently.
    - In the System Settings (or a dedicated section of Forecast Organizer), implement a **Special Events manager**. Here, users can **create special event entries** that define periods of time with unique demand patterns (e.g. a major sports event, holiday week, etc.).
    - For each special event entry, capture: a **Name** (free text to describe the event), **Category** (perhaps type of event, user-defined categories like "Holiday" or "One-off"), **Start Date** and **End Date** of the event, and a **Comparison Period** of equal length. The comparison period might be the timeframe in the past that will serve as a baseline for this event (for example, the same week last year or a similar event in history).
    - Provide basic add/delete functionality: the user should be able to add a new event, remove an event, import a list of events (if they have many predefined), or export their events list for backup.
    - These special events should be stored globally so they can be applied in different forecast scenarios. The idea is to predefine abnormal periods and later apply adjustments for them.
  - _Apply Special Event Adjustments:_ Use the Forecast Organizer to adjust the forecast for specific special event periods using an existing forecast template.
    - In the **Forecast Organizer interface**, allow the user to select one or multiple special events (from those defined) that they want to apply to the current scenario's forecast. For example, they might pick "World Cup 2025" special event.
    - Also allow selection of a **Forecast Adjustment template** (created in the Forecast Adjustment feature) that contains the general settings for adjustment. This template would include breakdown choices and possibly the overall growth assumptions, but now it will be applied focusing on the special event dates.
    - When the user runs the organizer (e.g. clicks "Run Forecast for Special Events"), the system should execute a forecast adjustment **only for the chosen special event periods**. This means it will adjust the load factors or passenger numbers on the flights that fall within those event dates. It would likely use the comparison period specified in the event to scale the scenario. For instance, if last year's comparable week had 100k passengers and this event expects 120k, it will uplift this year's corresponding week's flights to accommodate the increase.
    - The system should combine the special event effect with the overall forecast: essentially replacing or tweaking the results from the general forecast for those particular days. After running, the **seat load factors (or other metrics) for the special event days are updated** in the scenario to reflect the special event's impact.
    - Save this as a new template or scenario state if needed. The UI might list this run under a "Special Event adjustments" history. The user should then be instructed (as per documentation) that after handling special days, they should run the regular Automated Forecast Adjustment for the remaining days. This means the special days are done separately for higher accuracy, and the general adjustment will fill everything else without overriding the special days.
    - Essentially, the Forecast Organizer coordinates multiple forecast adjustments: one for special events (fine-tuned with special baseline) and one for normal periods. This two-step approach yields a final forecast where unusual periods are accounted for distinctly. Provide feedback on completion, such as "Special event forecast applied for \[Event Name\]: X flights adjusted." The results can be viewed in the Load Data view (e.g. PAX Total view now showing those days with their new SLF).
- **Publish Scenario**
  - _Setup Publication:_ Allow the user to input details and prepare the scenario data for publishing to another module (B Capacity).
    - Provide a form or dialog in the **Publish Scenario** section where the user can fill in any required metadata about the scenario. For example, they might specify a name or description for the scenario, the target planning horizon, or select which scenario (if multiple open) to publish. (The instructions just mention "fill out settings as required for your exercise," which could include selecting what to publish or any version notes).
    - Validate that the scenario is complete and saved, and that required fields (if any, such as a scenario name or target module selection) are provided.
  - _Publish to B Capacity:_ Transfer the scenario's data to the B Capacity module for further use.
    - On confirming publish, package the scenario's relevant data - all flight schedules (movements) and associated load data (passenger forecasts, etc.) - into the format expected by **B Capacity**. This may involve formatting data about each flight (times, linked flights, cancellations, etc.) and each flight's loads (pax, bags) so that the capacity planning tool can use it for resource calculations.
    - Execute the publish action, which could be writing this data to a shared database, sending a file, or triggering an API call to B Capacity. Essentially, **export the scenario** so it becomes available in the "Published Scenarios" list.
    - After a successful transfer, list the scenario in a "Published Scenarios" pane on the interface (the user guide suggests it will appear in a box on the right). This list shows all scenarios that have been published for capacity planning, for traceability.
    - Ensure the user receives confirmation (e.g. "Scenario 'Summer 2025 Plan' has been published to B Capacity") or errors if something went wrong (like data validation issues). Once published, the airport capacity module's users can then load this scenario for further analysis.
- **Create Report**
  - _Report Configuration:_ Provide a wizard or form to define the content and scope of a scenario comparison report.
    - Allow the user to **choose a comparison dataset (Comparison Product)** for the report - for example, they might compare the current scenario's forecast against last year's actual figures or against another scenario. This selection tells the system what "baseline" to use in the report for side-by-side comparison.
    - Provide inputs to specify the **time period** the report should cover (e.g. Q1 2025, or Jan-Dec 2025). The report will include data from this period in both the scenario and the comparison.
    - Let the user select **breakdown dimensions** for the report. Present a list of possible breakdowns (similar to other sections: airline, region, month, etc.) and let them pick which ones and in what hierarchy will appear in the report. For instance, they could choose "Airline" and then "Month" to have the report show data by airline per month. Move chosen fields into a "Selected" box to confirm inclusion.
    - Include an option to apply a **Group Filter** to the report if needed. This would limit the report to a subset of flights (e.g. only a certain terminal's flights, or a specific airline group). If selected, only data that matches that filter will be aggregated in the report.
    - Allow selection of which **metrics (products)** to include. For example, the user might choose to report on Movements (flights), Passengers, and Bags. They would move those into "Selected" for the report. The report generator will then include columns for each selected metric.
    - Provide toggles or icons for **absolute vs. relative values** - the user can specify if they want the report to show raw numbers, percentage changes, or both. (e.g. show passenger counts and also % change from last year). They might click an icon to indicate inclusion of percentage change columns.
    - Validate that at least one metric and one breakdown are selected (or otherwise the report would just be a trivial total) before allowing the next step.
  - _Generate and Output Report:_ Create the report with the specified parameters and present it to the user, with options to view or export.
    - Once configuration is done, generate the report data by **aggregating the scenario and comparison data** according to the breakdowns. For each combination of breakdown categories, calculate the scenario's totals and the comparison's totals for each selected metric. Also compute the differences: the absolute change (scenario minus comparison) and the percentage change, if requested.
    - Implement a **"View Report"** functionality: display the resulting report on screen in a readable format. Likely use a table where rows are breakdown categories (with sub-totals) and columns include Scenario value, Comparison value, Absolute change, Percent change for each metric. Also include a graphical element like a breakdown chart if specified (the guide mentions a Breakdown Chart showing scenario vs comparison figures, possibly a bar chart for each breakdown category).
    - Also provide an **"Export"** option to output the report to an Excel file. When the user clicks export, generate the report in the background (this may take a few seconds for large data). Save the file in a designated location (e.g. a "Generated Export Files" repository) and then either prompt the user to download it or make it accessible via a link or icon. Confirm where it's saved and allow opening it directly in Excel via a click.
    - Ensure the report output clearly distinguishes cases with no data. Implement the logic described for handling absolute/percentage changes: if a flight or value exists in scenario but not in comparison (or vice versa), instead of showing "0" or "0%" it should show an appropriate indicator (e.g. "+" for new flights with no prior value, "-" for flights that existed before but are now gone). This makes the report more informative by highlighting completely new or disappeared items rather than treating them as zero changes.
    - Once viewed or exported, the report can be used by stakeholders. The interface might allow the user to tweak parameters and regenerate as needed. This feature ensures that decision-makers can get a formatted summary of the scenario versus baseline, which can guide where further manual adjustment or attention is needed in the plan.
- **Create Dashboard**
  - _Dashboard Configuration:_ Enable the user to assemble a custom dashboard of key scenario metrics and visualizations for at-a-glance monitoring.
    - Provide an interface for **selecting the elements** to include in a dashboard. These elements could be high-level KPIs (like total movements, total passengers), charts (movements over time, load factor by airline, etc.), or tables. Let the user pick from available widgets - for example, "Total PAX vs Last Year (Gauge)", "Movements by Day (Line Chart)", "Top 5 Airlines (Bar Chart)", etc.
    - Allow configuration of each chosen widget: for instance, if a chart should focus on a certain terminal or airline group, allow the user to set that filter for that widget. Or if the dashboard is for a specific period or season, ensure all components are aligned to that context (perhaps default to the scenario's full period).
    - Let the user specify layout preferences if applicable (maybe choose how multiple charts are arranged on the screen). Since the user guide doesn't detail this, you might keep it simple with a preset layout where each selected widget will appear.
    - Provide a name for the dashboard and an option to save the dashboard configuration for reuse or sharing. This would store the selection of widgets and their settings under a dashboard title.
  - _Dashboard Display & Sharing:_ Generate the interactive dashboard for the scenario and provide output options.
    - Render the **dashboard view** containing all the selected components. Each component should display live data from the scenario. For example, show a number widget for "Total Flights = X" alongside a comparison value if relevant, or a chart showing trend lines for scenario vs. comparison over months.
    - Ensure the dashboard is interactive where it makes sense: if a chart has tooltip details or the ability to filter by clicking (e.g. clicking a segment highlights related data), incorporate those interactions. The purpose is to allow the user (and viewers) to glean insights quickly.
    - Provide an **option to export or publish the dashboard**, perhaps as a PDF or an image for inclusion in reports, or even as an HTML page if the system supports web dashboards. This would enable sharing with others who don't have the B Tactical software.
    - If multiple dashboards can be created (for different focuses), allow the user to manage them (open, close, switch dashboards). Otherwise, assume one at a time.
    - The created dashboard acts as a high-level report that updates automatically if the scenario data changes. It's a snapshot of key metrics and can be used in presentations or for monitoring scenario outcomes without diving into detailed grids.
