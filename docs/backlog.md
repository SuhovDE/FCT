# Backlog of Tasks for Implementing the B Tactical Application

## 1\. Project Setup and Architecture

- **Initialize Blazor Solution with DevExpress UI** - _Purpose:_ Set up the Blazor project structure and integrate DevExpress Blazor components for rich UI controls. _Scope:_ Includes creating a Blazor Server (or WebAssembly + ASP.NET Core host) project and installing DevExpress UI library. Configure DevExpress themes and ensure the component suite is ready for use in pages (grids, charts, etc.). _Inputs/Outputs:_ A running Blazor framework with DevExpress components rendered (e.g., a sample page with a DevExpress data grid). _Dependencies:_ .NET 5/6+ SDK, DevExpress Blazor nuget packages, no domain model needed yet.
- **Configure Entity Framework Core with Multi-DB Support** - _Purpose:_ Enable the backend to work with multiple database providers via EF Core. _Scope:_ Set up the DbContext and connection configuration so that the application can target **at least two database systems** (e.g. SQL Server and PostgreSQL) without code changes. Use provider-agnostic features of EF Core and avoid SQL-specific queries. _Inputs/Outputs:_ AppSettings or environment configs for selecting the database provider and connection string; the output is a functioning DbContext that can connect to the chosen DB. _Dependencies:_ Project setup must be done; requires installing EF Core and relevant provider libraries.
- **Establish Tiered Architecture and Services** - _Purpose:_ Lay the groundwork for a clean separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data. _Scope:_ Create core service classes (e.g., ScenarioService, ImportService, ForecastService) and repository or data-access layers to encapsulate EF Core operations. Ensure these services are registered for Dependency Injection. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Template services with method stubs (e.g., methods to get scenarios, import data, calculate forecasts). _Dependencies:_ Requires DbContext configured; no UI dependency.

## 2\. Domain Model and Database Schema

- **Design Core Domain Entities (Scenario, Flight, etc.)** - _Purpose:_ Create the primary data models representing the airport schedule and forecast scenario data. _Scope:_ Define EF Core entities and relationships for:
- **Scenario:** Represents a forecast scenario or plan. Fields for unique ID, name, description, planning horizon (date range), creation date, etc. (and later versioning info).
- **Flight/Event:** Represents a single flight schedule entry within a scenario. Include fields like flight number, airline, origin, destination, departure/arrival times, aircraft type, capacities, etc. Link each Flight to its Scenario (foreign key).
- **Load Parameters:** Extend the Flight model with fields for forecast parameters - e.g. passenger seat load factor, transfer rate, baggage rate per flight[\[1\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=business%20year%20to%20the%20year,System%20module%20features%20Import)[\[2\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=business%20years,dashboards%20and%20views%20aggregating%20and). These can be stored in the Flight entity or a related entity if one flight can have multiple parameter sets. Ensure defaults can be set (e.g., 100% if not adjusted).
- **User & System Groups:** (See grouping tasks below for details, but initial entity can be stubbed if needed).
- Possibly **Reference Data**: Entities for Airline (code, name), Airport (code, name, region), AircraftType (code, capacity) for use in grouping and validation[\[3\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,imports%20and%20flags%20mismatches%20instantly).  
    _Inputs/Outputs:_ C# classes annotated for EF Core and a migration script for creating corresponding tables. _Dependencies:_ Project and EF setup complete. Future tasks (import, forecast calc, UI) will depend on these models.
- **Implement Database Migrations and Seeding** - _Purpose:_ Initialize the database schema and seed essential reference data. _Scope:_ Use EF Core migrations to create tables for all entities. Include seed data for **system-defined groups** and reference tables as applicable. For example, seed common airline and airport codes, and default groupings (e.g., a group for "All Flights" or default region categories) that the system provides by default[\[3\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,imports%20and%20flags%20mismatches%20instantly). _Inputs/Outputs:_ A migration DLL or scripts and a database updated to the initial schema. The output includes initial data in lookup tables (airlines, airports, etc.) and system groups. _Dependencies:_ Domain entities designed; EF context configured.
- **Multi-Database Testing Task** - _Purpose:_ Verify that the schema and queries work on multiple providers. _Scope:_ After defining models and migrations, test applying migrations on at least two providers (such as Microsoft SQL and PostgreSQL or SQLite) to ensure compatibility. Adjust data types or indexes if any issues arise (e.g., use provider-agnostic types). _Inputs/Outputs:_ The outcome is a confirmation that the database layer runs on different databases (no runtime code output beyond logs). _Dependencies:_ Schema design and migrations must be ready.

## 3\. Master Data and Group Management

- **Implement System-Defined Groups (Reference Categories)** - _Purpose:_ Provide built-in groupings of flights for analysis (e.g. by airline, region, flight type) that come with the system. _Scope:_ Define what **system groups** are available (for instance, grouping flights by all domestic vs. international, or per airline, etc.). Use reference data to determine membership (e.g., if an airport's country differs from home country, mark flight as international). Store these groups in a Group entity with a flag indicating system-defined. _Inputs/Outputs:_ A populated list of system groups in the database (e.g., "All Flights", "By Airline: &lt;AirlineName&gt;", "Domestic Flights", etc.). _Dependencies:_ Reference data (airports, airlines) should be in place to derive group membership; domain model for Group exists.
- **Implement User-Defined Group Entity and Relations** - _Purpose:_ Allow users to create custom groupings of flights or routes for tailored analysis[\[3\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,imports%20and%20flags%20mismatches%20instantly). _Scope:_ Extend the Group model to support **user-defined groups** with a many-to-many relation to flights (or criteria-based membership). Provide attributes like group name, description, and owner (if multi-user context, otherwise just mark as user-created). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Database tables linking Group &lt;-&gt; Flight for membership (or storing filter rules if criteria-based approach is used). The result is the ability to store arbitrary flight collections as groups. _Dependencies:_ Flight and Group entities in place; basic system group concept established.
- **Group Management UI (Create/Edit Groups)** - _Purpose:_ Provide a front-end interface for users to define and manage their groups of flights. _Scope:_ Develop a Blazor page or dialog to create new groups by selecting criteria or flights. For example, let the user filter flights by airline/destination and save that set as a named group (e.g., "Regional Europe Flights"). Include editing (renaming group or updating its membership) and deletion of user groups. Use DevExpress components (like ListBox or TagBox for selecting multiple airlines or flights) for a rich experience. _Inputs/Outputs:_ UI forms where user inputs group name and selects members or rules; output is a new Group record in DB with its members. _Dependencies:_ Flight data should be loaded (perhaps a list of flights or airlines to choose from); Group entity and backend APIs to save groups.
- **Integrate Groups into Filtering & Reporting** - _Purpose:_ Make groups functional by integrating them into the filtering and reporting mechanisms of the app. _Scope:_ Implement the ability to filter the view (flights list or dashboards) by group membership (e.g., user selects a group and sees only flights in that group)[\[4\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=they%20spread)[\[3\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,imports%20and%20flags%20mismatches%20instantly). Also allow reporting modules to aggregate by group (e.g., total passengers for a user-defined group). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Extension of queries to include a group filter (SQL WHERE clause or LINQ predicate for group membership). Outputs are filtered lists or grouped summaries in the UI. _Dependencies:_ Group definitions must be in place; relevant UI pages (flight list, dashboards) exist to accept a group filter input.

## 4\. Flight Schedule Importing

- **Implement Schedule Import Service (SIR/SSIM Parser)** - _Purpose:_ Enable importing future flight schedules in industry-standard formats into a scenario[\[5\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=revenues%2C%20security%20forecasts%20or%20rostering,dashboards%20and%20views%20aggregating%20and). _Scope:_ Develop a backend service or module (ImportService) that can parse **SIR or SSIM7** schedule files (which contain flight schedules) and map them to Flight entities. Support client-specific CSV formats if needed via a flexible parser design. Include field mapping for flight number, origin, destination, times, etc., and use reference data to resolve codes (e.g., IATA airport codes to Airport entities). _Inputs/Outputs:_ **Input:** a schedule file (text or CSV). **Output:** a collection of Flight objects ready to be saved in a chosen Scenario. _Dependencies:_ Flight and Scenario models must exist; possibly reference data for validation (to reject unknown airport codes).
- **UI for Schedule File Upload and Import** - _Purpose:_ Provide a user-facing interface to import schedule files into a scenario. _Scope:_ Implement a Blazor page or dialog where users can select a scenario (or create a new one) and upload a schedule file. Use a DevExpress Upload control if available, or standard input, with progress indication. Once uploaded, call the ScheduleImportService to parse and import flights. Show summary of import results (e.g., number of flights added, any errors). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input is the user's file and scenario selection; output is a populated scenario in the database and a UI confirmation (or error report if parsing fails). _Dependencies:_ ScheduleImportService must be implemented; Scenario entity and at least one scenario must exist to import into (consider allowing import to a new scenario on the fly).
- **Automated Data Mapping & Validation** - _Purpose:_ Improve import robustness by auto-matching fields and ensuring data quality[\[6\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,prevent%20errors%20before%20they%20spread). _Scope:_ If multiple schedule formats are supported, implement logic to **auto-detect or map columns** (e.g., if a CSV has different headers, allow configuration or intelligent matching to known fields). Also perform data validation during import: flag flights with invalid times, unknown airport codes, or duplicate entries. Provide feedback on these issues (e.g., in the import summary, list flights that were skipped or corrected). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Enhancements to the import process that produce a log of mapping decisions and validation errors. Output includes cleaned and verified flight records in DB. _Dependencies:_ Basic import must be working; reference data (airports/airlines) for validation; logging or error reporting mechanism in place (could use UI or a log file).

## 5\. Scenario Management and Versioning

- **Implement Scenario Creation & Deletion** - _Purpose:_ Allow users to create new planning scenarios as containers for flights and forecasts[\[7\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=With%20Polaris%E2%80%99%20Scenario%20Management%20Module%2C,to%20organize%20and%20compare%20outcomes). _Scope:_ Back-end: Add service methods to create a new Scenario (with given name, date range, description, etc.) and delete an existing scenario. Ensure deleting a scenario cascades to its flights and associated data. Front-end: Provide UI controls to create a scenario (e.g., a "New Scenario" button in a Scenario Explorer page) and to remove scenarios (with a confirmation prompt). _Inputs/Outputs:_ User input for scenario details; output is a new Scenario record in DB or removal of one from DB. _Dependencies:_ Scenario model in place; no flights needed for creation; UI should list scenarios.
- **Implement Scenario Duplication (Save as Version)** - _Purpose:_ Enable creating a new scenario by copying an existing one, to support "what-if" scenario versions and comparisons[\[8\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=With%20Polaris%E2%80%99%20Scenario%20Management%20Module%2C,organize%2C%20compare%2C%20and%20refine%20outcomes)[\[9\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,can%20safely%20test%20and%20adjust). _Scope:_ Back-end: Service method to duplicate a scenario's definition and all its flights (and related data like load factors). This effectively creates a snapshot or version branch of a scenario. Maintain a reference to the "parent" scenario or a version number for traceability. Front-end: UI action (e.g., "Duplicate" button next to a scenario) to trigger the copy. Optionally, allow user to name the new scenario (default name like "Scenario X - copy"). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input is the source scenario (and new name); output is a new scenario in DB with identical content (flights, parameters). _Dependencies:_ Basic scenario CRUD done; import and editing features ensure original scenario has data to copy.
- **Implement Scenario Version Tracking** - _Purpose:_ Manage scenario versions and provide rollback or history if needed[\[10\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,can%20safely%20test%20and%20adjust). _Scope:_ Extend the scenario model to include version metadata (e.g., version number or reference to an original scenario). If a version control approach is desired, implement a mechanism to **archive** old versions or revert changes: for example, maintain a change log of flights or a snapshot of scenario state before major edits. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Possibly a "ScenarioHistory" or similar log table capturing changes (flight added/removed, parameters changed) or storing previous states. The output is the ability to restore a prior state or at least see differences. _Dependencies:_ Duplication covers major use-case; full version control is optional - if implemented it depends on an event logging system or explicit user action to save versions.
- **Scenario Explorer UI** - _Purpose:_ Provide a centralized UI to list and manage scenarios[\[7\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=With%20Polaris%E2%80%99%20Scenario%20Management%20Module%2C,to%20organize%20and%20compare%20outcomes). _Scope:_ Create a Blazor page "Scenario Explorer" showing all scenarios in a grid or list. Display key info (name, date range, last modified, parent scenario if any). From this page, users can: select a scenario to open it, create new, duplicate, archive (mark as inactive), or delete scenarios. Use DevExpress Grid for features like sorting and filtering scenarios by name or date. _Inputs/Outputs:_ UI displays scenario list (input from DB query); user actions produce outputs like new scenario created, scenario duplicated, etc., reflected in the list. _Dependencies:_ Scenario CRUD and duplication must be in place; no flight data needed for listing.
- **Archive/Activate Scenarios** - _Purpose:_ Allow scenarios to be archived (hidden from active list) rather than deleted, to preserve past versions without cluttering the UI[\[8\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=With%20Polaris%E2%80%99%20Scenario%20Management%20Module%2C,organize%2C%20compare%2C%20and%20refine%20outcomes). _Scope:_ Implement a boolean flag "IsArchived" on Scenario. Provide UI control to archive/unarchive. Archived scenarios are excluded from main lists by default (user can toggle view to include them). This helps in version management when many scenarios accumulate. _Inputs/Outputs:_ A scenario's archive status is updated in DB; output is that scenario moves to an "Archived" section in the UI. _Dependencies:_ Scenario model and explorer UI.

## 6\. Flight Schedule Editing (Scenario Content Management)

- **Flights Listing & Basic Editing UI (FEG)** - _Purpose:_ Display and allow editing of flights in a scenario via a **Flight Editor Grid (FEG)** - the central interface for scenario content. _Scope:_ Implement a Blazor page or component that shows all flights of the selected scenario in a data grid (DevExpress DataGrid or TreeList). Enable standard data grid features: sorting, filtering by columns (e.g., by airline or destination), and inline editing. The grid should show key fields (flight number, origin/dest, times, aircraft, etc., plus calculated fields like seat load factor%). _Inputs/Outputs:_ **Input:** selected scenario's flight list from DB. **Output:** displayed grid and any user edits captured (but not yet saved). _Dependencies:_ Scenario must be chosen and loaded; flight data present; DevExpress grid component.
- **Add New Flight (Schedule Augmentation)** - _Purpose:_ Allow users to add new flights to a scenario (to model additional services)[\[2\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=business%20years,dashboards%20and%20views%20aggregating%20and). _Scope:_ In the Flight Editor UI, provide a way to insert a new flight. This could be an "Add Flight" form or an inline blank row in the grid. Fields to input: flight number, origin, destination, days of operation or frequency, schedule times, aircraft type, etc. On save, create a Flight record in the DB for that scenario. _Inputs/Outputs:_ User enters flight details (perhaps with dropdowns for airport and aircraft for consistency); output is a new Flight entity persisted and shown in the grid. _Dependencies:_ Reference data (airports, airlines) for dropdown selections; scenario context known for linking the flight.
- **Edit Existing Flight Details** - _Purpose:_ Support modifications to existing flights, such as schedule changes or equipment changes[\[2\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=business%20years,dashboards%20and%20views%20aggregating%20and). _Scope:_ Users can edit fields of a flight in the grid (e.g., change aircraft type or time). If frequency is modeled (e.g., 7x weekly vs specific days), provide UI for that as well (perhaps a dialog). Save changes back to the database. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input is user-edited values in the UI; output is an updated Flight record. _Dependencies:_ Flight Editor UI in place; consider validations (no impossible times, etc.).
- **Frequency & Equipment Change Utilities** - _Purpose:_ Provide convenient operations for adjusting flight frequency and aircraft equipment in bulk[\[2\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=business%20years,dashboards%20and%20views%20aggregating%20and). _Scope:_ Implement specific features to modify services: e.g., a tool to change a flight from daily to 4x weekly (maybe by selecting specific days to operate) or to change all flights of a certain route to a new aircraft type. This could be a multi-select and edit operation in the grid or a separate dialog where user picks criteria (like "all flights by Airline X to Destination Y, change frequency from daily to 2x/week"). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: criteria for selecting flights and the desired change. Output: multiple Flight records updated in one operation. _Dependencies:_ Basic add/edit in place; filtering or grouping to identify the set of flights to change; ensure consistency (e.g., if reducing frequency, possibly remove some instances).
- **Implement Turnaround Flight Linking** - _Purpose:_ Model the relationship between inbound and outbound flights that use the same aircraft (turnarounds) in the scenario. _Scope:_ Extend the Flight model to have an optional link (e.g., RelatedFlightId or a turnaround group identifier) to connect an arriving flight with its subsequent departure. In the UI, allow the user to link two flights as a turnaround pair (for example, an inbound flight arriving at an airport that turns around to become an outbound flight). Enforce that the turnaround departure cannot depart before the arrival plus a minimum ground time (perhaps configurable). _Inputs/Outputs:_ If user links Flight A to Flight B as a turnaround, store the relationship and update any dependent data (e.g., ensure times make sense, possibly calculate **turnaround time**). Output might include visual cues in the UI (such as grouping linked flights together or an icon). _Dependencies:_ Flight records must exist (likely the flights should share the same aircraft type or number); may depend on a reference setting for minimum turnaround times.
- **Implement Flight Cancellation Handling** - _Purpose:_ Allow marking or removing flights to simulate cancellations in a scenario. _Scope:_ Provide a way for the user to **cancel a flight** - either by deleting it from the scenario or by toggling a "canceled" flag. The UI could offer a checkbox or context menu "Mark as Canceled". Canceled flights might be visually distinguished (e.g., struck-through or colored) and excluded from passenger forecast calculations. Ensure that if a flight is part of a turnaround pair, canceling one can optionally cancel the return leg (prompt the user). _Inputs/Outputs:_ User action on a flight (cancel); output is either the flight removed from DB or its status flagged as canceled. _Dependencies:_ Basic editing and linking in place; forecast calculation logic must check the canceled flag to omit those flights from results.
- **Data Validation on Flight Inputs** - _Purpose:_ Prevent or alert about inconsistent flight data in a scenario. _Scope:_ Implement checks when adding or editing flights: e.g., arrival time must be after departure (for the same flight record), no duplicate flight number on same route/day, turnaround departures cannot violate ground time, etc. Provide immediate feedback in the UI (DevExpress grid can show validation errors). Also ensure that all required fields (origin, dest, times) are present. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input is the flight data being entered/changed; output could be error messages or blocked save if validation fails. _Dependencies:_ Editing features above; possibly use DevExpress validation framework in the grid or form.

## 7\. Load Factor and Demand Adjustment

- **Implement Load Factor Assignment Interface** - _Purpose:_ Let users assign passenger load factors, transfer rates, and baggage rates to flights or sets of flights[\[1\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=business%20year%20to%20the%20year,System%20module%20features%20Import)[\[2\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=business%20years,dashboards%20and%20views%20aggregating%20and). _Scope:_ Develop UI for viewing and editing load-related parameters. This could be part of the flight grid (columns for Load Factor %, Transfer %, Bags/flight) or a separate pane/dialog where a user selects a flight (or group of flights) and sets these values. Support different levels: a simple mode (one global factor applied to all flights by default - corresponding to "management mode"), and an expert mode (fine-tune per flight or per route)[\[11\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=baggage%20rates,sophistication%3A%20%E2%80%9Cmanagement%E2%80%9D%20versus%20%E2%80%9Cexpert%E2%80%9D%20modes). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input from user: numeric values (percentages, etc.) for each factor; output: those values saved to each Flight record (or related entity). _Dependencies:_ Flight model has fields for these factors; flights exist from import; possibly scenario mode (management vs expert) that toggles detail vs bulk assignment.
- **Bulk Load Factor Editing by Group or Filter** - _Purpose:_ Speed up the application of load factors by allowing group-based or bulk edits[\[12\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,or%20refine%20individual%20flights). _Scope:_ Implement functionality to apply a given load factor or rate to multiple flights at once. For example, "Set all flights by Airline X to 80% load factor" or "Increase transfer rate by +5% for flights in group 'Holiday Peaks'". In the UI, this can be a multi-select of flights or using the group filter to narrow down, then an "Apply load to filtered flights" action. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: selection (or filter criteria) and new factor values; output: many Flight records updated in one operation. Provide feedback confirming the number of flights updated. _Dependencies:_ Groups and filtering should be working to easily select subsets; load factor fields present.
- **Incorporate Special Events and Anomalies** - _Purpose:_ Support adjustments for special events (e.g., holidays, festivals) that can affect loads[\[1\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=business%20year%20to%20the%20year,System%20module%20features%20Import). _Scope:_ Provide a way to input special event data (dates or date ranges with expected effects on passenger loads). This might be a simple form where the user specifies "Event X from date Y to Z with +10% passengers" or similar. The forecast calculation engine will use this to adjust load factors or passenger numbers for flights during those periods. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: event definitions with time span and impact factors; output: stored events and logic in forecast to apply modifications (e.g., multiply load factor for flights on those dates). _Dependencies:_ Forecast calculation logic (next section) must be able to use these events; likely requires date fields on flights and comparing with event calendar.
- **Management vs Expert Mode Toggle** - _Purpose:_ Simplify the interface for casual use or unlock advanced controls for power users[\[11\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=baggage%20rates,sophistication%3A%20%E2%80%9Cmanagement%E2%80%9D%20versus%20%E2%80%9Cexpert%E2%80%9D%20modes). _Scope:_ Implement a setting or toggle at the scenario level or user level for "Management" vs "Expert" mode. In management mode, hide or auto-manage detailed parameters (maybe use default load factors across the board), presenting only high-level controls. In expert mode, allow granular per-flight editing and all advanced features. Ensure the UI responds to the mode (e.g., show/hide certain columns or panels). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: user toggling mode (or scenario flagged as simple/advanced); output: UI adjusted accordingly (and possibly default assumptions applied under the hood for management mode). _Dependencies:_ All editing features exist (expert mode uses them); defaults for management mode are defined (could be global load factor or templates).

## 8\. Forecast Calculation Engine (FEG)

- **Develop Forecast Calculation Service (FEG Core)** - _Purpose:_ Compute passenger and baggage forecasts based on the flight schedule and assigned factors - essentially the "Forecast Engine/Generator (FEG)" of the application. _Scope:_ Implement a back-end module (ForecastService) that iterates over each flight in a scenario and calculates key results: e.g., **passenger count** = seats \* load factor, **transfer passenger count** = passenger count \* transfer rate, **bags** = passenger count \* bag rate, etc. Sum or aggregate these values as needed for reporting (by day, by route, total scenario). The calculations should operate on each _single flight event_ (as B Tactical forecasts are based on individual flight events[\[13\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=market%20expertise%2C%20e,System%20module%20features%20Import)). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: a scenario ID (or the scenario object with its flights). Output: computed results, possibly in a data structure like a list of flight result objects or directly updating fields in Flight (e.g., adding a calculated passenger count field). The service might also produce aggregate summaries (e.g., total passengers per day). _Dependencies:_ Load factors and other parameters must be set for flights (defaults if not edited); flight schedule data loaded.
- **Incorporate Forecast into Data Model** - _Purpose:_ Decide how to store or represent the calculated forecast results. _Scope:_ If large data volumes are expected, it might be inefficient to store every calculation persistently. A decision is needed: either store calculated passenger counts, etc., in each Flight record (update during calc) or generate on the fly for reporting. Possibly create a separate entity for forecast outputs (especially if we want to keep results of different scenarios or versions for comparison). Implement the chosen approach: e.g., add fields to Flight like CalculatedPassengers, or a ForecastResult table keyed by Flight ID. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Updated schema or in-memory structures for results. Output could be persisted results in DB (making reporting easier). _Dependencies:_ ForecastService logic; database if persisting results.
- **Validate and Handle Edge Cases in Forecast Calc** - _Purpose:_ Ensure the forecasting engine handles unusual cases gracefully. _Scope:_ Add logic for scenarios such as flights with no load factor set (use default or average), or flights marked canceled (exclude them from results). If a flight has a load factor over 100% or other impossible values, clamp or warn. Ensure that if reference data is missing (e.g., unknown aircraft capacity), the service can still proceed (perhaps skipping or using assumptions). _Inputs/Outputs:_ The input is the raw flight data with possibly incomplete info; output is either a completed calculation or an error log for flights that could not be computed. _Dependencies:_ Forecast calc core in place; reference data (aircraft seat count if needed to cap passengers = min(seats, calculated pax)).
- **Performance Optimization for FEG** - _Purpose:_ Ensure the forecast generation runs efficiently even for large schedules (seasonal or multi-year forecasts)[\[14\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,can%20safely%20test%20and%20adjust). _Scope:_ If scenarios contain tens of thousands of flights, optimize calculations using bulk operations or parallelism. For example, use EF Core queries to update calculations in SQL, or use multi-threading in C# to distribute the calculation of flights. Test the performance with a large dataset. _Inputs/Outputs:_ No direct user input; this is internal. The output is improved speed (measured in time to compute forecast for X flights). _Dependencies:_ Basic calculation must be correct; sample large data set (maybe import a season schedule) to test.

## 9\. Dashboard and Visualization

- **Design Scenario Dashboard Overview** - _Purpose:_ Provide a high-level visual summary of a scenario's forecast results[\[15\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=changes%20to%20existing%20services%20%28e,planning%20sophistication%3A%20%E2%80%9Cmanagement%E2%80%9D%20versus%20%E2%80%9Cexpert%E2%80%9D). _Scope:_ Create a Dashboard page in Blazor that presents key metrics: total passengers, total flights, perhaps peak day or busiest route, etc., for the selected scenario. Use **DevExpress Charts and Gauges** to illustrate important data (e.g., a gauge for average load factor, a KPI card for total annual passengers). This dashboard should update after recalculating forecasts. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: scenario (with computed forecast results). Output: visual components (charts, gauges, text) showing aggregated numbers. _Dependencies:_ ForecastService should have been run to provide data; DevExpress visualization components integrated.
- **Time-Series Charts (Passenger Trends)** - _Purpose:_ Visualize how passenger traffic evolves over the planning horizon. _Scope:_ Using forecast results, plot time-series charts such as **monthly passengers** over the scenario period, or passengers per week[\[16\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=%2A%20Export%20at%20flight,in%20summaries%20and%20comparisons). Use DevExpress line or bar charts. Ensure the data is grouped by time buckets (month/week) on the backend. Possibly allow toggling different series (e.g., compare against last year actual if data available - though not in scope unless actual stats imported). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: aggregated data by month/week from forecast results. Output: an interactive chart on the dashboard. _Dependencies:_ Requires date info on flights and calculated passenger counts; forecast must be done.
- **Peak Capacity Visualization (Runway Constraint Check)** - _Purpose:_ Highlight when the flight schedule exceeds runway capacity limits. _Scope:_ Implement logic to calculate the number of movements (takeoffs/landings) per hour in the scenario and compare with a defined **runway capacity** (e.g., 40 movements/hour, or a user-specified value). Visualize this in a chart or timeline - for example, a bar chart of flights per hour with a line overlay for capacity. Mark hours where capacity is exceeded. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: flight schedule times from scenario; output: a chart or table showing hours vs. movements, and perhaps a list of capacity overruns (hours where count > limit). _Dependencies:_ Flight data must include scheduled times; user or system must provide the capacity constraint (could be a config or a field in scenario like "runwayCapacity").
- **Aggregated Views by Category** - _Purpose:_ Enable analysis of forecast results by various dimensions (airline, route, group, etc.)[\[15\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=changes%20to%20existing%20services%20%28e,planning%20sophistication%3A%20%E2%80%9Cmanagement%E2%80%9D%20versus%20%E2%80%9Cexpert%E2%80%9D). _Scope:_ Create a page or component that can display aggregate results in a pivot or grid format. For example, total passengers by airline, or by destination, or by user-defined group. Utilize DevExpress Pivot Grid or DataGrid with grouping to allow dynamic grouping/summing in the UI. The user should be able to pick a dimension (or multiple) to group by. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: user selection of grouping dimension (or pre-defined views for common ones). Output: a table of results (e.g., each airline with total flights and passengers for the scenario). _Dependencies:_ Forecast results accessible; reference data to translate codes to names; DevExpress grid/pivot component usage.
- **Interactive Filtering on Dashboard** - _Purpose:_ Allow users to filter the dashboard data by criteria (date range, airline, group, etc.) to focus on specific subsets[\[4\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=they%20spread). _Scope:_ Add filter controls (dropdowns or multi-selects) on the dashboard page. For example, a dropdown to select an airline or a group, which then filters all charts and summaries to only include flights matching that filter. The filtering should apply across all visualizations for consistency. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: user's filter selections; output: updated charts/tables reflecting the filtered dataset. _Dependencies:_ Groups and basic filtering functionality should be ready; the dashboard components should redraw based on filtered data queries.

## 10\. Scenario Comparison and Analysis

- **Implement Scenario Comparison Selection UI** - _Purpose:_ Provide a way for the user to choose two scenarios to compare side-by-side[\[17\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,in%20summaries%20and%20comparisons). _Scope:_ Create a comparison screen where two scenario dropdowns (or pickers) are available. The user selects "Scenario A" and "Scenario B" from the list of scenarios to compare. Optionally, also select which metrics to compare (passengers, flights, etc., though likely all key metrics by default). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: two scenario identifiers from user; output: triggers retrieval of both scenarios' data for comparison. _Dependencies:_ Scenario list available; possibly requires both scenarios' forecasts pre-computed.
- **Compute Differences Between Scenarios** - _Purpose:_ Derive meaningful differences in traffic and other metrics between two scenarios. _Scope:_ In the backend, implement logic to **compare scenario outcomes**. For example, compute the difference in total passengers, difference in flights count, difference per airline or per day if needed. If possible, identify specific schedule differences: flights present in one scenario and not the other, or flights with changed frequency. This could involve a diff of flight lists (by flight number and date). Focus on aggregate differences for high-level insight (e.g., Scenario B has +5% passengers vs Scenario A).[\[18\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=,in%20summaries%20and%20comparisons) _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: two scenarios' data (flights and results); output: a data structure containing differences (absolute numbers and percentages). Possibly also a list of added/removed flights. _Dependencies:_ Both scenarios' data must be accessible (likely loaded via services); if not already calculated, run forecast calc for each scenario first.
- **Comparison Results UI (Charts & Tables)** - _Purpose:_ Present the scenario comparison in a clear visual form. _Scope:_ Develop UI elements to show the comparison: e.g., a **side-by-side dashboard** of Scenario A vs Scenario B, or a combined chart. Some ideas: a bar chart with two bars for each month (one per scenario) to illustrate differences over time; a summary table listing key figures for each scenario and the delta. Also highlight the biggest changes (which airline or route sees the most increase/decrease). If flight-level comparison is implemented, show a list of new flights (only in B) and removed flights (only in A). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: difference data from comparison logic; output: rendered charts and tables. _Dependencies:_ Comparison calculation done; DevExpress charts can plot multiple series for A vs B; grid can show a comparative table.
- **Scenario Impact Analysis** - _Purpose:_ Extend comparison to analyze _why_ metrics differ (optional deeper insight). _Scope:_ If data permits, implement features to drill down from a difference to the contributing factors. For example, if Scenario B has more passengers, provide a breakdown: X% due to new flights, Y% due to higher load factors, etc. This could be done by grouping differences by cause (if such metadata is tracked, e.g., if user duplicated scenario and changed certain routes' loads). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: scenarios' detailed data; output: an explanatory breakdown (maybe text or chart) of differences. _Dependencies:_ This is advanced and depends on having metadata of scenario changes or at least heuristics (e.g., detect that certain routes were added). Not strictly required, but a nice-to-have analysis feature.

## 11\. Reporting and Export Modules

- **Flight Schedule Export (CSV/Excel)** - _Purpose:_ Allow users to export the detailed flight schedule of a scenario for offline analysis or sharing[\[16\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=%2A%20Export%20at%20flight,in%20summaries%20and%20comparisons). _Scope:_ Implement an export function that takes the scenario's flights (and perhaps calculated results per flight) and downloads it as a CSV or Excel file. Use a .NET library (or DevExpress's export if available in the grid component) to generate an Excel with appropriate columns (flight details, passengers, etc.). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: user triggers "Export Schedule" for a scenario; output: a file download containing the data. _Dependencies:_ Flight data and results must be present; if using the grid's built-in exporter, grid must be loaded.
- **Aggregated Report Export** - _Purpose:_ Enable exporting of summary reports, such as total passengers by month or by airline, for use in presentations or further analysis[\[16\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=%2A%20Export%20at%20flight,in%20summaries%20and%20comparisons). _Scope:_ Provide options to export charts or summary tables. This could include generating a PDF report of the scenario's dashboard or an Excel file of pivoted data (e.g., a sheet for traffic per month, per airline, etc.). Implement logic to gather the aggregated data similar to what the dashboard shows, and format it into a report. Optionally, provide templates (e.g., a predefined Excel template where data is inserted)[\[16\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=%2A%20Export%20at%20flight,in%20summaries%20and%20comparisons). _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: user selects "Export Report" and possibly chooses a format (PDF/Excel). Output: a file with charts/tables, or an Excel with multiple sheets of data. _Dependencies:_ Dashboard calculations available; a reporting library or custom formatting code.
- **Scenario Comparison Export** - _Purpose:_ Allow exporting the results of a scenario comparison for distribution. _Scope:_ Similar to the above, but for comparison: generate an output (Excel or PDF) that contains the side-by-side comparison of two scenarios, including key metrics and any charts. For Excel, possibly two sheets or one sheet with both scenarios' data and diffs. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: user triggers export on comparison view; output: file with comparison data (and possibly visuals). _Dependencies:_ Comparison must be computed; the format might reuse some reporting logic.
- **Save and Reuse Report Configurations** - _Purpose:_ (Optional) Save time for users by remembering which data they export frequently[\[16\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=%2A%20Export%20at%20flight,in%20summaries%20and%20comparisons). _Scope:_ Implement a simple mechanism to save "report definitions" or templates. For example, allow a user to configure a set of output columns or a pivot layout and save it under a name. Later, they can rerun that report on a new scenario without reconfiguring. This could be as simple as saving preferences (in local storage or DB) for the last used export settings. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: user chooses to save current report settings; output: a stored template (maybe as JSON) under the user's profile or global config. _Dependencies:_ Basic export functionality working; user authentication or at least a place to save user-specific data.
- **Reporting Module Integration** - _Purpose:_ Integrate the reporting features smoothly into the UI workflow. _Scope:_ Ensure that throughout the app, at relevant pages, export options are present. E.g., on the flights page, an "Export to Excel" for raw flights; on the dashboard, an "Export Summary" button; on comparison page, an "Export Comparison" button. Also, if possible, integrate with any existing DevExpress reporting tools for a polished output. _Inputs/Outputs:_ This is more of a UI/UX task - outputs are the presence of buttons/menus for exports on each page, and they call the underlying export functions. _Dependencies:_ All specific export implementations must be done.

## 12\. Additional Features and Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **User Authentication & Authorization** - _Purpose:_ _(If multi-user usage is expected)_ Secure the application and allow role-based access. _Scope:_ Implement authentication (likely Azure AD, Identity or similar if needed) and ensure only authorized users can perform certain actions (e.g., only admins can delete scenarios, etc.). This also ties into user-specific data like saved report templates or user-defined groups, which should be owned by a user account. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: user login info; output: an authenticated session. _Dependencies:_ Not strictly mentioned in B Tactical features, but necessary for a complete app if multiple users.
- **Audit Trail of Changes** - _Purpose:_ Record what changes were made to scenarios (for accountability and version reasoning). _Scope:_ Implement logging of key operations: imports, flight edits, load changes, etc., possibly with timestamp and user. This could be a simple log table or more complex change history per scenario. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: any create/update/delete action; output: a log entry saved. _Dependencies:_ Basic features implemented; user identity if needed to log who made the change.
- **Testing and QA Tasks** - _Purpose:_ Verify the correctness and reliability of each module. _Scope:_ Write unit tests for services (import parsing, forecast calculations, group filtering logic, etc.) and integration tests for end-to-end scenario creation to report generation. Also perform user acceptance testing on the UI for all major workflows (schedule import → adjust loads → view dashboard → compare scenarios → export report). Ensure calculations align with expected results on sample data. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Test cases (inputs) and expected outputs for each; a suite of passing tests and documented outcomes. _Dependencies:_ All functional modules should be in place; test data (perhaps use known small schedules with hand-calculated forecasts to verify).
- **Performance and Scalability Review** - _Purpose:_ Ensure the application can handle the data volumes (e.g., an entire season's schedule) and multiple concurrent users. _Scope:_ Profile the application with a large scenario (for example, all flights for a busy airport over a season) and identify any slow points (perhaps the initial load of flights into the grid, or the forecast calculation). Optimize queries (e.g., use efficient filtering in DB rather than in-memory) and consider paging for very large flight lists in the UI. Test with multiple users if applicable to ensure the state management (especially in Blazor Server) can handle it. _Inputs/Outputs:_ Input: stress test scenarios; output: any code or configuration changes to improve performance (like adding indexes in DB, enabling server-side Blazor data virtualization, etc.). _Dependencies:_ All features completed and working correctly; this is a final tuning step.

Each of these tasks together covers the full feature set of B Tactical as derived from its documentation and analysis. Following this backlog, an AI coding agent can implement the **forecasting core (flight-based traffic forecasts)**, **scenario editing and versioning**, **filtering and grouping**, **reporting and exports**, **scenario comparison**, and various domain-specific features like **turnaround linking** and **runway capacity checks**, all within a Blazor + DevExpress UI and an EF Core multi-database backend. This ensures replication of B Tactical's user-facing capabilities - from schedule import to detailed forecasting dashboards - in a modern web technology stack[\[19\]](https://www.aeroexpo.online/prod/beontra-leidos-company/product-180627-23328.html#:~:text=industry%20standard%20schedule%20files%20%28e,planning%20sophistication%3A%20%E2%80%9Cmanagement%E2%80%9D%20versus%20%E2%80%9Cexpert%E2%80%9D)[\[16\]](https://jetpack.ai/polaris/#:~:text=%2A%20Export%20at%20flight,in%20summaries%20and%20comparisons). All modules are broken down with clear inputs/outputs and dependencies, ready for autonomous implementation.
